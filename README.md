# laps insights

Laps Insights is a long-term project aimed at providing rental kart pilots with graphical insights to analyze their races.

Currently, as laps insights evolves, users will need to upload a CSV file containing their lap times in the Henakar circuit, in Madrid, Spain. The system will then generate various graphs for users to explore.

The ultimate goal is to have access to lap times from the most important circuits in Spain without users needing to upload the CSV files.
